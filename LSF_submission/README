Run the cluster algorithm on a computing cluster with Platform LSF.

1) Edit the "script_template.sh"
2) Make sure required software is availble on computing cluster (R and R-packages igraph and splancs)
3) Run "bsub < script_template.sh"; additional options may be applicable 

"script_template.sh" details:

#BSUB -n 1         <-- number of nodes is 1
#BSUB -W 72:00     <-- maximum run time is 72:00. The system will kill the job after that time.
#BSUB -M 64000000  <-- maximum memory in KB. The system will kill the job if the memory is exceeded. 

Memory and runtime depend on the data size. The values given should be sufficient for 30000 observations.
